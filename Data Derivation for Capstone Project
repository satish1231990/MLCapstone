Data Derivation For Project

To help David in his search we will need to access following data:

- The Localities of Bogotá, Colombia from Wikipedia: https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Localidades_de_Bogot%C3%A1

- The coordinates (latitude, longitude) of these Localities of Bogotá from Open Street Map APIs

- From Foursquare we will need following venues data:
  - The burger joint venues of the Localities
  - The offices venues of the Localities
  - The high schools venues of the Localities
  - The universities venues of the Localities

We will then leverage the data in order to determine which locality is the most appropriate in order to locate the burger joint.
